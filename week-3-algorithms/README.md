# Week 3 - Algorithms
## Topics
Wow, this was a good one. I had no prior knowledge of data structures or algorithms (at least what they were exactly), but it was perfectly broken down by Professor Malan and I'm just amazed. Learned about how sorting methods and recursion can be used to make searching through data types much easier, how to create data structures and associate attributes with them, linear vs. binary search, and running time (big O notation).
