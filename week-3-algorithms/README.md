# Week 3 - Algorithms
## Topics
Wow, this was a good one. I had no prior knowledge of data structures or algorithms (at least what they were exactly), but it was perfectly broken down by Professor Malan and I'm just amazed. Learned about how sorting methods and recursion can be used to make searching through data types much easier, how to create data structures and associate attributes with them, linear vs. binary search, and running time (big O notation).
## Programs
tideman - Probably the hardest problem I've ever done in my life. Implements the Tideman voting system.

plurality - Holds a plurality vote for several candidates.

answers - Lab, determined which compiled files implemented which sorting algorithms by testing on files with numbers.
