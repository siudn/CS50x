Learned about foundations of most programming languages, like conditionals, loops, variables, abstraction, etc. Also learned how compiling and libraries work, as well as the command-line interface. Two assignments and a lab written in C:

mario - A program that creates a triangle of blocks "#" with the number of rows being the user's input. Meant to replicate the pyramid block structures from the Mario games. 

cash - A program that calculates the number of coins (pennies + nickles + dimes + quarters) a cashier owes in change based off the user's input of cents.

population - A program which uses a growth function to calculate the number of years it will take a population to grow from a start size to an end size. The start and end sizes are user-inputted.
